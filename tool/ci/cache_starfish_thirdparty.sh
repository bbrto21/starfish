# everything else here -- see worker.yml/x64_test.yml/wpt_status_nightly.yml,
# which each fetch it directly, no proxy needed since it's plain public
# github.com unlike everything else in PATHS). But the `update none` above
# is a LOCAL .git/config setting on *this checkout* -- and self-hosted
# runners reuse their on-disk workspace (including .git) across unrelated
# jobs of this same repo. Leaving it set here silently turned every later
# job's `git submodule update third_party/wpt` on that same reused
# workspace into a no-op (git honors update=none and skips, exit 0, no
# fetch) -- confirmed on a real run: worker.yml's test job reported "wpt
# serve failed: no wpt checkout ... (missing ./wpt)" despite its own
# `git submodule update third_party/wpt` step reporting success. Restore it
# before this job ends, same as the old prepare_source_without_thirdparty.sh

# Each submodule's .git is a thin gitlink FILE pointing at this checkout's

# all_standalone embeds each submodule's real git directory into its own
# working tree in place of the pointer, making it self-contained and safe
# to move anywhere. "third_party" isn't itself a submodule (just a plain
# directory containing many, e.g. third_party/escargot, third_party/
# deviceapi, ...) -- the "_all" / --recursive form expands that to every
# individual submodule under it, including nested ones (escargot's own
# third_party, walrus's sljit), in one call.

# nanomsg's own CMakeLists.txt runs `git describe`/`git diff` against its

# -- confirmed on a real consumer-job run: `tar xzf` restores this dir
# owned by whatever UID the tarball recorded, which doesn't match the
# consuming container's user, and git refuses to touch a repo it doesn't
# recognize as owned by the current user ("fatal: detected dubious
# ownership"). Rather than teach every consumer job about safe.directory
# for this one nested path, just drop the standalone .git entirely here:
# nanomsg's own CMakeLists already falls back cleanly to its checked-in
# third_party/nanomsg/.version file when `.git` doesn't exist (confirmed
# that file is present), and an unpopulated submodule (no .git at all, not
# even a dangling gitlink) is exactly what CODE-Actions/checkout's
# unconditional post-job `git submodule foreach --recursive` cleanup
# already silently skips -- confirmed on a throwaway repo: exit 0, no
# attempt to even enter the path.

# Self-hosted/pooled runners reuse their on-disk workspace across unrelated
# jobs of this same repo (see the wpt comment above), and a prior job that
# actually ran WPT tests there leaves behind a real venv, including a
# symlink pointing at an absolute host path (third_party/wpt/_venv3/bin/
# python3.9 -> /usr/bin/python3.9) -- confirmed on a real run: extracting
# that tarball on windows.yml's runner failed outright
# ("tarfile.LinkOutsideDestinationError: ... would link to
# 'D:\usr\bin\python3.9', which is outside the destination", Python 3.12+'s
# default extraction filter refusing a symlink target that escapes the
# destination). A plain `tar czf third_party` archives whatever's on disk
# under that path regardless of git's view of it, so exclude it explicitly
# rather than relying on it merely being unpopulated.
#
# --exclude='third_party/escargot/test/*': same class of contamination --

# test262, vendortest, web-tooling-benchmark; only escargot's own
# "third_party" and walrus's "third_party/sljit" are explicitly inited
# above), but *other* jobs sharing this same reused workspace do populate
# them to actually run escargot's test suite. Confirmed on a real cache
# tarball: these five directories alone accounted for ~614MB of a 3.35GB
# tarball -- pure leftover, never read by anything this cache serves.
